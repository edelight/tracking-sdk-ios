### 2. Integrate ShopLoveTracking into your app

Navigate to your Application Delegate source file and add 

```objc
#import "SLTTracking.h"
```

at the top of you file. In the `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` or `-applicationDidFinishLaunching:` method add the following calls to SLTTracking.


```objc
[SLTTracking setLogLevel:SLTLogLevelVerbose];
[SLTTracking appDidLaunch:@"{YourAppToken}"];
```

Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your App Token.
